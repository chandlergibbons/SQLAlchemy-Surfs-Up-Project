# SQLAlchemy Surfs Up Project

![](Surf.gif)

For this project I took a SQLite dataset about Honolulu, Hawaii and with SQLAlchemy in Python ran a climate analysis on it. 

1. First I utilized SQLAlchemy create_engine to connect to the sqlite database.


2. I then used SQLAlchemy automap_base() to reflect my tables into classes and save a reference to those classes called Station and Measurement.


3. I then linked Python to the database by creating an SQLAlchemy session.
